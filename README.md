## Overview
This project is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all countries at one place and details about the country. The project has search and filter functionality and also a dark mode.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learnt about CSS Grid and Flexbox with CSS variables. In JavaScript, I applied concepts of map and filter as well as async programming. I also worked on localstorage and document object model.

### Continued development
I plan to continue building this project in React and also add other features like caching the information which is frequently visited, so that the API is called on new requests more than repeated requests.
